                    <h2>Experieces</h2>
                    <p>I've started drawing during 2nd grade. People would call me gifted and started following my drawings for tracing. Though it was more of a mere hobby and took drawing breaks from months to years. During 8th grade I started to enjoy drawing again and had a huge spike of imporvement in the 2020 COVID era. From 2023 I have not improved much but discovered a style of art that will forever inspire me. A person named Graeme Borland, creator of an Indie game titled <i>Sort The Court</i>, has his own website dedicated on drawing daily sketches (you can check it out <a href="https://sketch.graemeborland.com">here</a>). To me they were not drawings, they were masterpieces, might be an exaggeration but I digress. It just amazes me on how he can create wonderful world building on just simple sketches which made me want to do the same. Here I am taking landscape references from <i>The Legends of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> and to drawing from my imagination. I still have ways to go but I want to know where this artistic direction takes me.</p>
